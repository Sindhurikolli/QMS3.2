Incident management Icm is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify,analyze,and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. These incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team IRT,an incident management team IMT,or Incident Command System ICS. Without effective incident management,an incident can disrupt business operations,information security,IT systems,employees,customers,or other vital business functions Incident management is considered to be much more than just the analysis of perceived threats and hazards towards an organization in order to work out the risk of that event occurring,and therefore the ability of that organization to conduct business as usual activities during the incident. An important part of risk management process and business resilience planning that Incident management is a real time physical activity to the planning that has happened to formulate the response to an incident be that a disaster,emergency,crisis or accident has been done so that effective business resilience can take place to ensure minimal loss or damage whether that is to tangible or non tangible assets of that organization. Efficient physical management of the incident making best use of both time and resources that are available and understanding how to get more resources from outside the organization when needed by clear and timely liaison ensure the plan is implemented.
